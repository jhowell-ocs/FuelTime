## Overview

FuelTime provides a streamlined digital solution for managing two essential administrative forms:

- **Fuel Reports**: Monthly fuel consumption tracking with vehicle information
- **Employee Timesheets**: Hours tracking with automatic calendar functionality and total calculations

Both forms feature professional PDF generation for official documentation and record-keeping.
